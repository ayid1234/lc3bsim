# LC3b Simulator

Implements a complete ISA, FSM, datapath, and microsequencer to process Assembly instructions compatible with the LC3b. Has a modified FSM, datapath, and microsequencer to process interrupts and exceptions. Accounts for 1-time interrupt, protection exceptions, unknown opcode exceptions, and unaligned memory access exceptions. 

**Note: Currently being updated to handle instructions using pipelined processing.
